# E08b-Adding-Tiles

this exercise has made my game now include rows of different colored blocks that disappear when hit for the player to work against. The scenes have been edited so that this could be done, adding in script and duplicating blocks, but there is no "died" print if the ball falls like mentioned in the end of the assignment. I was not able to find anything relating to that in the actual instructions, nor when I looked at the code I inserted in for the ball, so I assume it was either a mistake to have been included in the document or it is present in my game and I have not noticed.
